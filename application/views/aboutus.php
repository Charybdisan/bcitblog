    <h4>League of Legends Players</h4>
    <p>We are League of Legends Players.</p>
    <p>We've been playing the game ever since its debut.</p>
    <p>We play enough of the game to understand the mechanics, how to play properly against other plays, and how to respect</p>
    <p>both the meta of lanes and your fellow team mates.</p>
    <h4>Our mission</h4>
    <p>To help you become the best player you can be by providing enriched content and updates.</p>
